# SteamLink
Epic Games linked cross SteamGames on BigPicture
This is a simple application to execute EpicGames games (lol) through steam (Using BigPicture/SteamLink)
I made this because i wanted to play some games from epic games using steamlink and bigpicture.

1- Add a new shortcut to steam

2- Select steamlink as exe

3- Get the shortcut url from EpicGames and set it as paremeter. example:
    com.epicgames.launcher://apps/0584d2013f0149a791e7b9bad0eec102%3A6e563a2c0f5f46e3b4e88b5f4ed50cca%3A9d2d0eb64d5c44529cece33fe2a46482?action=launch&silent=true
    
4- Parameters are like:
    (epic games url) (Executable game name) (Timeout in seconds:Optional)
    
5- Final Parameter
  com.epicgames.launcher://apps/0584d2013f0149a791e7b9bad0eec102%3A6e563a2c0f5f46e3b4e88b5f4ed50cca%3A9d2d0eb64d5c44529cece33fe2a46482?action=launch&silent=true GTA5


This app is doing a timeout (65 seconds default). SteamLink will launch Epic Games Launcher and execute the game..., this will take time (Timeout Secs) 
I made this app a few months ago. This is just a backup. SteamLink/EpicGames probably works good without this app.
